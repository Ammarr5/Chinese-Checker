Heuristic Function is the difference between the Euclidean distance between PC marbles and the farthest position in the goal
and the Euclidean distance between the player marbles and the farthest position in its goal.
If PC reached this position (This place is occupied by PC Marble), The farthest position in the heuristic function is updated
to be the next farthest position and so on.
